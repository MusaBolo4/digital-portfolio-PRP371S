## Personality Assessment Evidence

I completed the formative assessment about personality assessment.
This showed what your personality matches with which career and working environment would be best suited.
based on what i learned it showed that I prefer structured environments, enjoy working independently, and pay attention to detailâ€”traits that are valuable in networking and security roles.

Screenshots of the assessment and marks are included.
