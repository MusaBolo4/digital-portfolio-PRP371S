## Skills and Interests Reflection (STAR)

**S** – I needed to identify what ICT skills I was good at and interested in.

**T** – I had to explore different tools, systems, and platforms during my practical training.

**A** – I completed several networking labs, worked on Packet Tracer simulations, and tested online platforms for ethical hacking.

**R** – I found a strong interest in configuring and securing networks. This encouraged me to pursue certifications like CompTIA Network+ and CCNA in the future.
