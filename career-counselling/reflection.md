## Career Counselling Reflection (STAR)

**S** – I was unsure about which area of ICT I should focus on for my future career.

**T** – I needed guidance to narrow down my career options and understand what suits me best.

**A** – I attended a career counselling session, completed a self-assessment test, and discussed my results with the advisor.

**R** – I discovered that I am best suited for roles involving networking, security, and cloud systems. The session helped me set more specific career goals and feel more confident about my direction.
