## CV Submission Reflection (STAR)

**S** – I had to submit my CV for assessment and for mock job applications.

**T** – I wanted to make sure it was submitted correctly and understood how the job application process works.

**A** – I uploaded the CV to Blackboard and also tested applying to real entry-level IT roles on job sites. I learned how to attach cover letters and tailor my CV per application.

**R** – I feel more confident about the job application process. I now know how to avoid common mistakes like incorrect formatting or missing documents, and I understand the importance of customizing my application for each job.
