## CV Submission Evidence

I submitted my CV to various platforms and for review. These include:
- Blackboard submission for academic review
- Online job platforms (LinkedIn, Indeed)
- A mock job application as part of work readiness training.

Screenshots of submission confirmations and application drafts are included in this section.

This experience helped me practice submitting my documents and understanding what employers expect.
