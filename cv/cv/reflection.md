## CV Creation Reflection (STAR)

**S** – I needed a professional CV to apply for internships and entry-level roles in IT.

**T** – My goal was to create a clear and industry-appropriate CV that highlighted my qualifications and skills.

**A** – I gathered my academic and practical experience details, used an online CV builder, and formatted it professionally. I also asked for feedback from a lecturer and revised it accordingly.

**R** – I produced a polished one-page CV that clearly shows my strengths in IT and communication networks. I now feel confident using it for applications and know how to update it as I gain more experience.
