## CV Creation Evidence
I had done formative assessment about how to create a cv.
I created a professional CV tailored for roles in IT, with a focus on communication networks, cybersecurity, and support services.

My CV includes:
- Personal details and career objective
- Academic background
- Key IT skills (networking, troubleshooting)
- Tools and technologies (Packet Tracer, Linux, Windows Server, etc.)
- Practical projects completed during coursework
- Certifications and short courses

I used a structured format to ensure itâ€™s clear and easy to read. I also reviewed several examples online and followed tips from work readiness training.
